I managed to solve all of the problems by myself and managed to find an optimal solution for most of them


Mistakes I Made:

    - I didn't consider all the little things that were stated in the problem description (Somthing highly discouraged by the author of the book)
        - That is why I was only able to find a suboptimal solution to the String Rotation Problem
    - I didn't know that CPython has a pretty naive implementation of recursion and that the stack frames are rather big
        - This proved to be invaluable for the Zero Matrix problem. Thus, I was not able to find an optimal solution
    - In one of the exercises I had to check for repeated characters and something I missed was that if the sequence of character is larger than the
      size of the alphabet, we get a repetition. This way, I could have solved the problem in O(1) for all strings with size bigger than the alphabet that we have 
    

Additional Notes:
    
    - It is too bad that CPython does not allows you to work directly with variable length buffers. Some of the solutions I wrote can be implemented even faster with languages that 
      support such buffers like C, C++, etc...
    

A good idea that came to me is that for further exploration of the problems in the book, I should write my own structures maybe in C and bind them to Python


Overal Satisfaction:
    - I am not nearly satisfied with my current skills. I failed two of the problems (ZeroMatrix and StringRotation).


I will proudly take the defeat and strive to be better !
